# Description

A simple rickroll script to prank the victim. Opens the terminal app and issues a command to open Rick Astley in a browser.

# Notes

## `nohup`

Runs a command with hangup signals (SIGHUP) ignored, so that the command can continue running in the background after you log out. _Note:_ `nohup` does not automatically background the command, so you need to end the command with an `&` to run it in the background.
